Instructions for packaging the monoOne font for Fedora 20:

mkdir -p build/SOURCES/
spectool -g -C build/SOURCES/ monoone-fonts.spec
cp monoone-fonts-fontconfig.conf build/SOURCES
rpmbuild --define "_topdir $(realpath build)" -ba monoone-fonts.spec

Note: this is my first package for Fedora, I'm neither familiar
with their packaging process nor their policies.
